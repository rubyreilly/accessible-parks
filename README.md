# Accessible Parks Project
The Accessible Parks Project is a search engine for finding parks in New York City that are accessible for people with disabilities.

Fetches names, addresses, and types of parks from the [Directory of Parks Disability Accessibility Facilities and Programs API](https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.cityofnewyork.us/4xyq-5bdm) provided by NYC Open Data.

I'm in the process of incorporating the Google Maps API for Geocoding, in order to allow users to search by zip code and find nearby parks.

Built with React (Javascript). Custom CSS styling.

## Development Setup
To install frontend dependencies run

```bash
npm install
```
To open in browser run

```bash
npm start
```

## Usage Example
Current functionality:
+ User can search parks by name
+ User can search parks by type using the dropdown menu

In the works:
+ User can search by zip code to find nearby parks
